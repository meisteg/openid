# INSTALL for OpenID Module


===== IMPORTANT =====

This version of the OpenID module requires phpWebSite 1.5.2 or higher. You
have to install phpWebSite >= 1.5.2 first - earlier versions of phpWebSite
will not work.

If you don't have phpWebSite installed, first get the latest code here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=15539

Then follow the install instructions found in the INSTALL file included in
the docs directory of that download. Once this is done then you can start
installing the OpenID module.


===== INSTALLATION =====

1. BACKUP YOUR DATABASE.  Never install this or any other module without
   doing this.

2. Download the .tar.gz or .zip file and unpack it.

3. Move the new directory into your phpwebsite mod directory.

    Example: If your phpwebsite directory is /home/httpd/htdocs, you would run:

    mv openid /home/httpd/htdocs/mod/openid

4. Go to your phpWebSite and install or upgrade "OpenID" from the Boost module.

5. Log out and log back in to your site to reset your environment before
   using the module.

   The module is now installed.  You can get there by going to "Control Panel"
   and clicking on "Administration".
